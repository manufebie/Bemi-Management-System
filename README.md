# Internship Project

From August 2017 untill Februari 2018 I had my Application Development internship in Jakarta, Indonesia. During this period I also functioned as HR Manager. Because 80% of their work was still done the "old fashioned" way, I suggested them to make us of software.

This way they would be able to automate a lot of their work and have a central place for their data. They were very happy with this idea and so I started building the software.

## Management Software

The goal of this project was to let every employee submit their daily tasks, create projects and upload essential documents.

I had a lot of fun building this project because it would be the first time I was able to show off other people what I was capable of using the Django Framework.
